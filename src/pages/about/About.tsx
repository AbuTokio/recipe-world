                      My love affair with coding started when I was just 14 years old. From that young age, I was
                      captivated by the power of code - the ability to create something from nothing, to solve problems,
                      and to bring ideas to life. I dove into programming headfirst, teaching myself through online
                      resources, tutorials, and countless hours of experimentation. While I was passionate and
                      dedicated, my journey was entirely self-taught and never formalized into professional training.

                      In early 2025, I made a life-changing decision. I realized that while I had built a solid career
                      in automotive, my true passion had always been coding. The voice in the back of my mind - the one
                      that whispered about creating software, building applications, and solving problems through code -
                      had never gone away. It was time to stop wondering "what if" and start taking action.

                      enrolled in a professional coding bootcamp to transform my self-taught skills into a professional
                      foundation and launch my new career as a software developer.

                      functionality. What started as an educational assignment evolved into something I'm truly proud of
                      - a fully functional recipe sharing platform that demonstrates my growing skills in modern web
